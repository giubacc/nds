# Interview Assignment - Naive Distributed Storage

Hello, dear candidate! Thanks for taking the time to try this out.

The goal of this test is to assert (to some degree) your skills as a software engineer. You're given a simple problem so you can focus on showcasing coding and problem solving. We encourage you to overengineer the solution a little to show off what you can do - assume you're building a production-ready application that other developers will need to work on and add to over time.

We accept tests written in any common language you can demonstrate being comfortable coding in but, since the role you're interviewing for puts a lot of emphasis on C, you might want to pick that to maximise your chance of a positive code review.

You're **allowed and encouraged** to use third party libraries, as long as they are free and open source. An effective developer knows what to build and what to reuse, but also how his/her tools work. Be prepared to answer some questions about those libraries, like why you chose them and what other alternatives you're familiar with.

As this is a code review process, please minimize generated code to the project, as this might make our jobs as reviewers more difficult, as we can't review code you didn't write.

_Note: While we love open source at SUSE, please do not create a public repo with your assignment in! This test is only shared with people interviewing, and for obvious reasons we'd like it to remain this way._
